# Token & Wildcard strategy

[what-are-wildcards](https://zyngasupport.helpshift.com/hc/en/55-csr-2/faq/8073-what-are-wildcards/)

Wildcard is a key to `Less for More` (more rp Return On less time Investment).

## A brief glance
> Wildcard combination: 🥝150% + 70%x5 + 30%x7, Wildcard time by default is 20:00 UTC or reacting to 5p+ online with ROI in mind.

> [Token donation](#token-donation)
> 1. ✅️Donate tokens as early as possible,
> 2. 🚫Stop donating tokens after 20m RPs is reached,
> 3. ⚠️Roll tokens left to next season before claiming your prize car

> - When both 30% and 70% are unfulfilled, fill up 30% first

> [Wildcard activation](#wildcard-strategy)
> - 🚫Hold 150% until the 2nd Monday

|Wildcard|Who is allowed to activate|Min online players|Min RP to generate by activator|
|--:|--|--|--|
|✅️+30%|any old member|3|30k|
|⚠️+70%|1m+RP contributor|5|50k|
|🚫+150%|admin only, unless authorized by admin|5|50k|

> - **Old member** (in comparison to new joiner in current or last season)
> - Whoever activated wildcard is expected to generate minium of ??+RPs to be considered serious use of a wildcard.

## Actual token coefficients from crew statistics
> Crew stat indicates 30% & 70% generated more RPs, including planned & unplanned wildcard campaigns

## Events suitable for intensive grinding

|--|--|--|--|
|matchmaking|automatic, ~30s|manual, ~mins|manual, ~15s|
|win/lose ratio|1:2|varies|1:1|

> 1. Wildcard for Showdown, win to lose ratio is 1:2. You should be able to complete 50 races of Showdown per hour when Refuelling by watching passive Ad or 80 races of Showdown per hour when refuelling for 20 Gold Coins. To complete 2 Showdown events, you would need to spend 13-20 hours.
> 2. Wildcard for Live races with swap &#x1F501; &#x1F502; &#x1F503; &#x1F504;, win/lose ratio is 1:1.

## Token donation
Tokens that each member should be able to collect per season
||&#x1F4D8;Season events|&#x1F4D9;Daily bonus (Event/Odd)|&#x1F4D7;Milestone rewards|Total collectible|85%+50%PC|100%+100%PC|

> - Collect tokens by expiry time from Daily Bonus, Milestone Prize, Season events (Crew Cup, Token Cup, Service Trial, Prestige Cup)
> - Donate tokens at earliest possible time so that we have wildcard available to activate.
> - Fullfil one wildcard then move to next. Do NOT split donations which delays wildcard campaigns.

> 🍎🍉Intensive grinding suits for highly organised crew of which most members
> 1. attend each wildcard campaign (>15p)
> 2. know how to quickly refuel
> 3. are busyman having little time playing
> 4. are willing to instantly refuel by paying gold coins

> 🍏🥝Extensive grinding suits for crew
> 1. hard to agree or act on wildcard time (<10p)
> 2. rely on natural refueling
> 3. having problem of communication due to restrictions by languages, tools, time zones
> 4. are not willing to spend too much time on coordination
>
> Keeping 150% blocked is crucial (ideally 150% is filled at last), otherwise 1k+ tokens will drop to the 2nd or even the 3rd 150%.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Typical practice for most crews is **Wildcard is activated by admin, unless authorized by admin.**
>
> For mature crew, self-governed would be ideal.

<details><summary>Old [!NOTE]</summary>

>  Whoever activated wildcard is expected to generate 50k+RPs to be considered serious use of a wildcard.
>
> **Why do we favour planned wildcard campaigns?**
> 
> Wildcard is supposed to boost RP generation for as many as possible. Crew members are located worldwide. Agreeing on common wildcard time is hard.
> 
> If we activate unplanned wildcard often, most would either come unprepared or miss.
> 
> But we also expect some authorised unplanned wildcards, to find more suitable time, etc. Current 20:00 UTC was found by unplanned wildcards.
>
> #### Day & Time
> 
> ✅️Wildcard is used as a DAY reminder of 🔶Weekly elite cup, 📘Token events, 📘RP events.
> 
> ✅️According to measurement, between 18:00 - 21:00 UTC, there were 20 active members. Wildcard time having generated over 0.5m RPs are 20:00 UTC, 2:00 UTC. Tho*B at 6:00 UTC activated wildcard 70% which generated 0.48m by 7p, was not bad.
> 
> 🚫Crew stats indicates, crew is not as active as usual between 10:00 Fri - 9:59 Sat UTC and generated less than 0.2m RPs in 70% campaign. Better to skip this period of time.
>
> 🚫No major events on Sunday
>
> 🚫Showdown should have been completed by Wednesday
>
> ✅️Wildcard combination to cover 20+hours which is roughly equivalent to the time needed to complete two Showdown events.
> 
> ~~Only one wildcard campaign per day to avoid tiredness~~
