> &#x1F34E;Intensive grinding suits for highly organised crew of which most members
> 1. attend each wildcard campaign (>15p)
> 2. know how to quickly refuel

> &#x1F34F;Extensive grinding suits for crew
> 1. hard to agree or act on wildcard time (<10p)
> 2. rely on natural refueling
>
> Crew stat indicates 30% campaign generated more RPs. So here is the priority, **30% -> 70% -> 150%**. If 30% is available, activate 30%, otherwise 70%. 150% is the last choice.
> 
> Wildcard time having generated over 0.5m RPs are 20:00 UTC, 2:00 UTC. Crew stats indicates, &#x1F6AB;crew is not as active as usual between 10:00 Fri - 9:59 Sat UTC and generated less than 0.2m RPs in 70% campaign. Better to skip this period of time.

> **Wildcard is activated by admin, unless authorized by admin.** For mature crew, self-governed would be ideal.
>
> **Why do we favour planned wildcard campaigns?**
> Wildcard is supposed to boost RP generation for as many as possible. Crew members are located worldwide. Agreeing on common wildcard time is hard.
> If we activate unplanned wildcard often, most would either come unprepared or miss. 
> But we also expect some authorised wildcard, to find more suitable time, etc. Current 20:00 UTC was found by unplanned wildcards.

> - Collect tokens by expiry time from Daily Bonus, Milestone Prize, Season events (Crew Cup, Token Cup, Service Trial, Prestige Cup)
> - Donate tokens at earliest possible time so that we have wildcard available to activate.
> - Fullfil one wildcard then move to next. Do NOT split donations which delays wildcard campaigns.
> - ~~Only one wildcard campaign per day to avoid tiredness~~
