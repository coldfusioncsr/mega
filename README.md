This crew is supposed to be friendly and supportive. We ride alongside each other to earn more rewards and have fun.

## Play smartly while align with crew goals
To make the crew sustainable, members need to decrease playing time to no more than 1 hour per day.
- Set reminders for high ROI(Return On Investment) events, `cup` (Weely Elite, Token, Crew), `Tournaments`
- Collect free **cars & parts** daily
- Earn **RP** without racing as much as possible
- Donate **tokens** by second Tuesday. Activate a **wildcard** when racing high RP events (`Showdown`, `Live races`) intensively (50+ races)
- Race againt bots in `Live races` to quickly earn **keys**

## Admins
are expected to lead by example, communicate, coordinate, help entire crew to earn more cars, parts over winnings.
- g1 ops, to keep active players in, inactive/naughty members out. While stablizing old members are important for consistent behaviors.
- g2 ops, to help members build an elite tuner car eligible for WEC, and remind members to attend 5 rounds of WEC in time.
- g3 ops, to survey and measure for best wildcard time to maximize RP, to help and remind members to collect and donate tokens in time, to encourage members to activate and attend wildcard campaigns.

deserve more respects, as they come to play as everyone else but spend extra time on managing crew. Two admins per season shift (first half / second half of the `Race Pass`)

### Alerts
Crew RP drops to 23m or less; WEC races won drops to 500 or less.

### Backlog
- the most races of WEC we won is 832. To win 900 races of WEC every week.
- Tournaments
