#### Options to refuel
1. Car naturally takes 7m36s to fill 1 fuel pip, 1h16m to fill full tank (10 pips)
2. Instantly fill 10 fuel pips for 20 gold coins
3. It takes 5-60 sec to receive 2 fuel pips by watching 1 **passive** video ad which pops up when fuel pips drop below 6. Comparably, proactively watching 1 ad recieves only 1 fuel pip.

#### Token & Wildcard strategy
- [Any unused Wildcard tokens will be lost at the end of each Crew Championship season, so make sure you use them up before the season ends!](https://zyngasupport.helpshift.com/hc/en/55-csr-2/faq/8074-what-happens-to-my-wildcard-tokens-at-the-end-of-the-crew-championship-season/)
