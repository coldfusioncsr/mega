#### Options to refuel
1. Car naturally takes 7m36s to fill 1 fuel pip, 1h16m to fill full tank (10 pips)
2. Instantly fill 10 fuel pips for 20 gold coins
3. It takes 5-60 sec to receive 2 fuel pips by watching 1 **passive** video ad which pops up when fuel pips drop below 6. Comparably, proactively watching 1 ad recieves only 1 fuel pip.

#### Token & Wildcard strategy
Given each person could donate 400 tokens per season.
- 30%(3h) x 3, two for each weekend, one optionally for last wildcard
- 150%(1h) x 2, for each weekday
- 70%(2h), for the rest
