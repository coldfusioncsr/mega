> 3. Watching 1 **passive** video ad (5-60 secs) which pops up when fuel pips drop below 6. Comparably, proactively watching 1 ad recieves only 1 fuel pip. [A guiide to watching Ads](https://www.reddit.com/r/CSRRacing2/comments/c4x6hc/a_guide_to_watching_ads/)

- g1 ops, to keep active players in, inactive/naughty members out
- g2 ops, to help members to be eligible for WEC, and remind members to attend WEC in time.
- g3 ops, to survey and measure for best wildcard time to maximize RPs, to help and remind members to collect and donate tokens in time.

### Backlog
