### Why do you play within a (well organized) crew?
1. Some season events require you to join a crew
2. To earn more rewards from crew essential events
3. To have fun through good teamwork

## Goals
1. 25-30 active members
2. 900 wins of `Weekly Elite Cup` for **parts** every week
3. 20m+ RPs for prize **car** every CSR season

## TODOs
1. inner-crew swap
2. the most wins of WEC we had is 764.

### Busyman's minimum playbook
1. Win 40 races of [`Weekly Elite Cup`](#g2---weekly-elite-cup)
2. Collect and donate 400+ tokens
3. Complete 'Prestige Cup'

### How frequently do you play
- [Season Schedule 1](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jsgWgXeBoPMRBNFMbDjJLuDbk90S9DuI_o8sPuSyBmI/htmlview), [Season Schedule 2](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iKkwmLYEPRktXw17auU2egdTSyIu6i1JdWZzMrI3wPk/edit)

|Frequency|Tasks|
|---------|-----|
|Once a day|&#x1F536;Weekly Elite Cup(8), &#x1F4D8;Season events, &#x1F4D9;Daily Bonus, &#x1F4D7;Milestone rewards|
|Every 8 hours|Live Races|
|Every 4 hours|Daily Battles, Bronze Crates|

#### Options to refuel
1. Naturally refueling 1 pip takes 7m36s, 1h16m for full tank (10 pips)
2. Spending 20 gold coins to instantly refuel full tank
3. Watching 1 **passive** video ad (5-60 secs) which pops up when fuel pips drop below 6. Comparably, proactively watching 1 ad recieves only 1 fuel pip. [A guiide to watching Ads](https://www.reddit.com/r/CSRRacing2/comments/c4x6hc/a_guide_to_watching_ads/)

To max a car, Yellow Elite Parts are needed but are very hard to earn. By winning 900 races of WEC, each member could earn 15 Yellow (Legendary) Elite Parts and 500 Elite Tuners Currency (2,300 ETC is equivalent to 20 YEP)

> **Wildcard is activated by admin, unless authorized by admin.** For mature crew, self-governed would be ideal.
>
> Crew stat indicates 30% campaign generated more RPs. So here is the priority, **30% -> 70% -> 150%**. If 30% is available, activate 30%, otherwise 70%. 150% is the last choice.
> 
> Wildcard time having generated over 0.5m RPs are 20:00 UTC, 2:00 UTC. Crew stats indicates, crew is not as active as usual between 10:00 Fri - 9:59 Sat UTC and generated less than 0.2m RPs in 70% campaign. Better to skip this period of time.

> - Collect tokens by expiry time from Daily Bonus, Milestone Prize, Season events (Crew Cup, Token Cup, Service Trial, Prestige Cup)
> - Donate tokens at earliest possible time so that we have wildcard available to activate.
> - Fullfil one wildcard then move to next. Do NOT split donations which delays wildcard campaigns.
> - ~~Only one wildcard campaign per day to avoid tiredness~~
